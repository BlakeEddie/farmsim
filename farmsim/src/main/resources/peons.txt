Leggy|21|M|God amongst men|Recently married, Leggy was born in the 1994, a height of 6'4".....Upon defeating magnum sidius and gaining his title for having magnificent legs, he enrolled in a BEng (Software) at UQ. He tutors CSSE2002 and DECO2800, and has a softspot for furry and feathered animals because his life was once saved by a duck named Sarge. His fame has grown far and wide,  so much so that peons across the globe build shrines in his honor. Today leggy is leading the righteous fight against unnecessary singletons with his inquisition, where he has been met with great resistance. Will he prevail?|java|eclipse|idgaf|agnostic|duck|tabs|brown|yes

Sc0urge|19|M|Tinkerer. Thinkerer. Drinkerer.|Over the years sc0urge has built up his reputation as an MLG farmer, nobody has lived to tell the tales but some say he spent over one thousand years in the mountains being trained in dust2 and singleton usage. Only known to reveal himself on slack it is said he spent nineteen years in a cupboard with nothing but a beer tap, 3 sticks of DDR3 ram and a rubber duck. Some say he holds the key to human survival and legend has it his programming skills were becoming so strong that the greek god, Zues, ruler of the sky smite his motherboard with a strike of lightning. Little did Zues know, Sc0urge had written an exception handler for this exact scenario, challenging the very essence of zueses power. The lightning strike caused the motherboard to fuse itself to the user, granting sc0urge infinite programming power.|NULL|Editing the binary directly|Gentoo|following of the dark lord sc0urge|sc0urge does not favour any one entity|Packet injecting tabs into other peoples code.|dirty, dirty blonde|not even waxed bruh
